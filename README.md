As I said earlier this is a Basic game named "NUMBER GUESSING".
As the name suggests , we will have levels of difficulty in which we can play this game and this is very user friendly for us.
Let me explain this in detail.


Header Inclusions: 
    The code begins with including necessary header files. iostream for input and output operations, 
    cstdlib for the rand() and srand() functions, and ctime for the time() function.
Namespace Usage: 
    using namespace std; is a directive that tells the compiler to consider all the entities in the std namespace as
    if they were declared in the global namespace. This is done to avoid having to prepend std:: to every standard library function or object.
Main Function:
    The program's execution starts from the main() function.
Random Seed Initialization: 
    srand(time(0)); initializes the random number generator with the current time as the seed. This ensures that the 
    sequence of random numbers generated by rand() will be different each time the program runs.
Variable Declarations:
    secretNumber: Holds th0e randomly generated secret number.
    guess: Stores the user's guessed number.
    chances: Represents the number of chances the player has to guess the number based on the selected difficulty level.
Difficulty Selection:
    The user is prompted to choose the level of difficulty by entering a number. Based on the input, the number of chances
    is set accordingly.
Random Number Generation:
    rand() % 100 + 1 generates a random number between 1 and 100 and assigns it to secretNumber.
Game Loop:
    A for loop iterates from 1 to the chosen number of chances. During each iteration, the user is prompted to input their guess.
Guess Comparison:
    If the guess matches the secret number, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the loop breaks.
    If the guess is lower than the secret number, the user is prompted to try a higher number.
    If the guess is higher than the secret number, the user is prompted to try a lower number.
End of Game: 
    After the loop ends (either by guessing correctly or running out of chances), the secret number is revealed, and a message thanking the
    player for playing is displayed.
Return Statement: 
    The main() function returns 0, indicating successfulÂ execution.
